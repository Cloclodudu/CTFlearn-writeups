The Super Secure Service

"My friend sent me this link: https://thekidofarcrania.github.io/MACObs/index.html to some sort of MAC checking service. <br>
I have no clue how it works, but it claims it is secure (I have my doubts on that promises). Can you figure out the "password" used to sign the message that they provided?"
